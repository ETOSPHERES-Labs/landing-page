            <p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
            <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING, INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING.

            <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
            <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.</p>
            
            <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
            <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>
            
            <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
            <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
            
            <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do this, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
            
            <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
            <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
            <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

            <h3>LinkedIn Insight Tag</h3>
            <p>This website uses the Insight Tag from LinkedIn. The provider of this service is LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>
            
            <h4>Data Processing by LinkedIn Insight Tag</h4>
            <p>With the help of the LinkedIn Insight Tag, we receive information about the visitors to our website. If a website visitor is registered with LinkedIn, we can analyze the key professional data (e.g., career level, company size, country, location, industry, and job title) of our website visitors and thus better align our site to the respective target groups. Furthermore, we can measure with the help of LinkedIn Insight Tags whether the visitors of our websites make a purchase or perform another action (conversion measurement). The conversion measurement can also be carried out across devices (e.g., from PC to tablet). LinkedIn Insight Tag also offers a retargeting function with the help of which we can display targeted advertising to visitors of our website outside the website, whereby according to LinkedIn no identification of the advertisement addressee takes place.</p>
            <p>LinkedIn itself also collects so-called log files (URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser properties, and time of access). The IP addresses are shortened or (if they are used to reach LinkedIn members across devices) hashed (pseudonymized). The direct identifiers of LinkedIn members are deleted by LinkedIn after seven days. The remaining pseudonymized data is then deleted within 180 days.</p>
            <p>The data collected by LinkedIn cannot be assigned to specific individuals by us as the website operator. LinkedIn will store the collected personal data of the website visitors on its servers in the USA and use it as part of its own advertising measures. Details can be found in LinkedIn's privacy policy at https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#choices-oblig.</p>

            <p>When you visit one of our pages where YouTube is embedded, a connection to YouTube servers is established. This tells the YouTube server which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p>
            <p>We use YouTube in enhanced privacy mode. According to YouTube, videos played in enhanced privacy mode are not used to personalize browsing on YouTube. Ads that are played in enhanced privacy mode are also not personalized. No cookies are set in enhanced privacy mode. Instead, so-called Local Storage elements are stored in the user's browser, which contain similar personal data to cookies and can be used for recognition. Details on the enhanced privacy mode can be found here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780.</p>
            <p>Further data processing operations may be triggered after the activation of a YouTube video, over which we have no influence.</p>
            <p>The use of YouTube is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offerings. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If appropriate consent has been obtained, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TDDDG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p>

            <h2>8. Our Services</h2>
            
            <h3>Handling of Applicant Data</h3>
            <p>We offer you the opportunity to apply to us (e.g., by email, post, or via our online application form). In the following, we inform you about the scope, purpose, and use of your personal data collected during the application process. We assure you that the collection, processing, and use of your data will be carried out in accordance with applicable data protection law and all other statutory provisions and that your data will be treated in strict confidence.</p>
            
            <h4>Scope and Purpose of Data Collection</h4>
            <p>When you send us an application, we process your associated personal data (e.g., contact and communication data, application documents, notes made during job interviews, etc.) to the extent that this is necessary for a decision on establishing an employment relationship. The legal basis for this is § 26 BDSG under German law (initiation of an employment relationship), Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (general contract initiation) and – if you have given consent – Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. The consent can be revoked at any time. Your personal data will only be passed on within our company to persons who are involved in the processing of your application.</p>
            <p>If the application is successful, the data submitted by you will be stored in our data processing systems on the basis of § 26 BDSG and Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship.</p>
            
            <h4>Data Retention Period</h4>
            <p>If we are unable to make you a job offer, you reject a job offer, or you withdraw your application, we reserve the right to retain the data you have transmitted on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) for up to 6 months from the end of the application process (rejection or withdrawal of the application). The data will then be deleted, and the physical application documents will be destroyed. The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is apparent that the data will be required after the 6-month period (e.g., due to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only take place when the purpose for further storage no longer applies.</p>
            <p>Longer storage may also take place if you have given consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) or if statutory retention obligations prevent the deletion.</p>
            
            <h4>Inclusion in the Applicant Pool</h4>
            <p>If we do not make you a job offer, you may be able to join our applicant pool. In the case of admission, all documents and information from the application will be transferred to the applicant pool in order to contact you in the event of suitable vacancies.</p>
            <p>Inclusion in the applicant pool is based solely on your express consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). The submission of consent is voluntary and is not related to the ongoing application process. The affected person can revoke their consent at any time. In this case, the data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted, provided there are no legal reasons for storage.</p>
            <p>The data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted no later than two years after consent has been given.</p>
